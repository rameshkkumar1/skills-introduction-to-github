# GitHub Skills Exercise - Completion Guide

👋 Hi @rameshkkumar1! I see you commented "Done" on the exercise issue, but looking at the repository state, it appears the **Introduction to GitHub** Skills exercise is not fully complete yet.

## Current Status ✅❌

- ✅ **Step 1: Create a branch** - You successfully created the `my-first-branch`
- ❌ **Step 2: Commit a file** - Missing the `PROFILE.md` file on `my-first-branch`  
- ❌ **Step 3: Open a pull request** - No PR from `my-first-branch` to `main`
- ❌ **Step 4: Merge your pull request** - Cannot merge until PR is created

## What You Need to Do

To complete the GitHub Skills exercise, please follow these steps:

### Step 2: Add PROFILE.md file

1. Switch to your `my-first-branch`:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.com
   - Click the branch dropdown and select `my-first-branch`

2. Create the PROFILE.md file:
   - Click **Add file** > **Create new file**
   - Name the file: `PROFILE.md`
   - Add this content:
     ```
     Welcome to my GitHub profile!
     ```
   - Commit with message: `Add PROFILE.md`

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request

1. After creating the file, GitHub will show a banner suggesting to create a pull request
2. Click **Compare & pull request**
3. Set the title: `Add my first file`
4. Add a description explaining what you've done
5. Click **Create pull request**

### Step 4: Merge the Pull Request

1. Once the PR is created, the exercise bot (Mona) will provide further instructions
2. Follow the prompts to merge your pull request

## Sample PROFILE.md File

Here's the exact content you need for the PROFILE.md file:

```markdown
Welcome to my GitHub profile!
```

## Why This Matters

This exercise teaches you the fundamental GitHub workflow:
- **Branching** - Create isolated development environments
- **Committing** - Save your changes with descriptive messages  
- **Pull Requests** - Propose and discuss changes
- **Merging** - Integrate approved changes into the main codebase

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
1. Check that you're on the correct branch (`my-first-branch`)
2. Ensure the file name is exactly `PROFILE.md`
3. Use the exact commit message: `Add PROFILE.md`
4. Follow the exercise instructions in issue #1

The automated exercise bot will guide you through each step once you complete them properly!
